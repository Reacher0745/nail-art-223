The Art of Russian Manicure
Best Russian Manicure In Dubai , also known as dry manicure, is a revolutionary nail care technique that focuses on gentle cuticle removal and nail shaping without the use of water. This innovative method allows for greater precision and control, resulting in smoother, more polished nails that last longer and are less prone to damage. At Code Hair Ladies Salon, we specialize in Russian manicure, offering unparalleled expertise and meticulous attention to detail.

Benefits of Russian Manicure:
Gentle Cuticle Care: The Russian manicure technique gently removes excess cuticle and dead skin around the nails, leaving them looking clean and well-groomed.
Precision Shaping: By shaping the nails without soaking them in water, Russian manicure allows for greater accuracy and control, resulting in perfectly sculpted nails with crisp edges and smooth surfaces.
Long-Lasting Results: Russian manicure helps to seal the nail plate, preventing moisture loss and enhancing the longevity of your nail polish or gel manicure.
Healthier Nails: By minimizing water exposure and reducing the risk of over-filing, Russian manicure promotes healthier, stronger nails that are less prone to breakage and splitting.
